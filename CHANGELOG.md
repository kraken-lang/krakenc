## [Unreleased]

### Note

This repository is currently a placeholder for the future self-hosted Kraken compiler. Development is taking place in the main [Kraken monorepo](https://github.com/kraken-lang/kraken) under the `compiler/` directory.

The compiler will be migrated to this repository after the completion of milestone v0.8.47 (Self-Hosted Compiler) when the implementation is stable and ready for independent development.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-02-05

- LICENSE (Apache-2.0)
